# Nmap

> Nmap (Network Mapper) is a free and open source (license) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory,
managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service
uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts
are available on the network, what services (application name and version)
those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are
running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens
of other characteristics. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but
works fine against single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating
systems, and official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows,
and Mac OS X.
