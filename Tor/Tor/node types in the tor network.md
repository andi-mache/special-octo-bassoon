In the Tor network, there are three main types of nodes that play specific roles in facilitating anonymous communication:

1. **Entry Nodes (Guard Nodes):**
   - The entry node is the first node in the Tor circuit that a user's traffic passes through.
   - It is responsible for encrypting the user's traffic and passing it on to the next node in the circuit.
   - Entry nodes are sometimes referred to as "guard nodes." Users' entry nodes change periodically for security reasons.

2. **Middle Nodes:**
   - Middle nodes receive encrypted traffic from the entry node and pass it on to the exit node.
   - These nodes have no knowledge of the source or destination of the traffic, as the data is encrypted in layers.
   - Middle nodes enhance security by ensuring that no single node in the circuit knows both the source and destination of the communication.

3. **Exit Nodes:**
   - The exit node is the last node in the Tor circuit before the traffic exits the Tor network and reaches its final destination on the regular internet.
   - Exit nodes decrypt the final layer of encryption and send the user's request to the destination server.
   - It's important to note that while Tor provides anonymity within the network, the traffic is decrypted at the exit node, so users should use end-to-end encryption (e.g., HTTPS) to protect their data beyond the exit node.

These three types of nodes work together to create a circuit that provides anonymity for users by encrypting and routing their traffic through multiple nodes in the Tor network. This multi-hop process makes it difficult for anyone, including the nodes themselves, to trace the origin and destination of the communication.
